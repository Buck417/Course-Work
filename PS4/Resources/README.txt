Version 2.0:
Updated on: 10/15/2015

Updated the Spreadsheet class with a save function, a method that better handles the three types of content that a cell can
contain and a way of keeping track of when a spreadsheet has been changed so that the user knows when they should save. There
is now a version system as well, which keeps track of multiple versions of a spreadsheet for the user.
